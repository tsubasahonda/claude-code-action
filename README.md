This project is forked from [claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) 

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action listens for a trigger phrase in comments and activates Claude act on the request.
